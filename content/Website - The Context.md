# The Context
We live in an era of history where seemingly every meaningful vector of life is eroding, degrading, depleting, flattening, and homogenizing.

We can all feel it and nobody seems to know what to do about it.

Techno optimists and determinists regale AI as a Messiah that will save us from the mess we created. Meanwhile, our local communities, cultures, societies, and digital / physical environments suffer, bleed, malfunction, and atrophy with seemingly no end in sight.

There is a knot of interconnected problems that have only continued to deepen and intensify over the decades.
## The Erosion of Everything
A lot of things are in decline and it's a sad state of affairs:
- The Erosion of Understanding
	- Information overload
	- misinformation / disinformation / deepfakes
	- signal / noise ratio
	- information density
	- AI pollution aka "informational microplastics"
	- limited cognitive capacities and resources to cope with this
	- difficulty navigating ethics of what's happening
	- fighting wars we have no understanding of why
- The Erosion of Connection
	- "the meaning crisis"
	- people have become disconnected from their relationship with meaning
	- division > unification
		- isolation
		- alienation
		- atomicity
		- individualism
		- lack of community
		- political and ideological polarization
		- separation from most resonant and natural self
	- educated out of following intuition and resonance
	- bullshit jobs, meaningless work
	- critical analysis > appreciative inquiry
	- critique > wonder
	- fear > love
	- broken and incoherent value and ethical systems
	- lack of a shared ownership of space and place
	- retreat to substance abuse and escapism
- The Erosion of Agency
	- the outsourcing of the designing and building of our digital and physical lived environments
	- imposed uniformity due to global-scale-constraints
	- reliance on centralized and fragile globally interdependent infrastructure where a disruption in one area can have cascading effects worldwide (crowdstrike ðŸ˜¬)
	- digital identity grows more fragmented by the day
	- left vulnerable and underprepared
		- loss of practical skills and knowledge
		- loss of knowing how to provide for our own needs
		- loss of control over our lives environments, food, digital tools
	- critical future infrastructure, both digital and physical, is being built as we speak (and without the input of the vast majority of humanity)
	- Dominance of a few global tech giants over digital infrastructure and data, impacting sovereignty and cultural autonomy.
	- loss of rights due to government overreach
- The Erosion of Privacy
	- surveillance capitalism
	- mass data extraction by governments, corporations, and unethical hackers
	- social cooling
	- digital labor theory
- The Erosion of Trust
	- public trust in institutions such as government, and media, at an all time low
	- incompetent politicians
	- corruption in government
	- mass media coordination
	- death of journalism
	- corporate infiltration of justice system (lobbying)
	- back door financial dealings
	- elderly career politicians who are woefully ignorant of technology passing regulations and legislation 
- The Erosion of Wellness
	- problems with our food
		- processed food
		- non-organic farming practices like pesticides
		- It's cheaper to buy food that's worse for you many times
	- industrial pollution and poisoning
	- separation from nature
	- for-profit and privatized healthcare has misaligned goals (not incentivized to holistically treat underlying conditions but rather to prescribe recurring bandaids)
	- mental health crisis
	- opioid epidemic and other drug epidemics
	- separation from community and support systems
	- basic human needs are not being addressed
	- lived environments are adversarial
		- littered with advertising
		- loss of what little "third places" we had left
		- car-centric infrastructure means walkable communities are few and far between
		- they were designed by a few and imposed on the many rather than grown and evolved from a seed as needs require
- The Erosion of Coordination
	- the "metacrisis" is deeply interconnected and requires integrated human coordination in context
	- dealing with complexity is humanity's Achilles heel
	- more decisions need to be made than at any other point in history and this will only grow but we're not so great at making collective decisions, and even struggle with making decisions for ourselves due to analysis paralysis / choice paralysis
	- technology scales, community doesn't 
	- Dunbar scale groups
	- lack of adequate tools
- The Erosion of Care
	- TBD
- The Erosion of Stability
	- TBD
## An Uncertain Future
As of all of that wasn't enough, the future is more uncertain than ever before. The stage is set for a future we can't even comprehend.

Technology advances and amplifies both the good and the bad. Sharp tools are very useful but they can both help and harm.

AI, blockchain, or any other technology will not save us. The Web didn't fix everything and in many cases even made problems much worse. Because the problem isn't even mostly technical, it's social.

There's plenty to be uneasy about:
- the future will not be like the past
	- exponentially faster rate of change
	- previously unimagined ways of living become realized
	- a whole ocean of new frontiers
- social tensions and collective sense of instability
- economic instability and volatility
- fear of seemingly inevitable potential collapse
- existing governance structures are fundamentally unequipped and inadequate to address these challenges
- who will be "left behind"
	- unequal access to technology
	- social outcasts
	- the disabled
	- the undervalued
	- people who don't fit the social "norms" 
	- ever widening chasm of wealth disparity
	- job security in the wake of AI

## How We Got Here
It's said you cannot fix problems with the same thinking that created them. So what is the soil in which these problems sprouted and grew from?
- Unregulated Capitalism
	- competition > cooperation
	- productivity and hustle culture
	- cut costs and boost margins
	- quantity > quality
	- self-perpetuating power structures
	- money and power centralize
	- misaligned incentives
	- everything is profit-driven
	- consumerism run rampant (supply/demand)
	- only things whose value can be quantified is treated as valuable
	- economic survival incentives, not an option to opt out, we are all implicated
	- misguided trust in market solutions
		- The belief that market forces alone can address social and environmental issues, often neglecting the need for collective action and regulation.
- An Industrial-Age Worldview
	- optimization
	- automation
	- efficiency-gains
	- mass production
	- globalization > localization
	- monoculture > ecosystems
	- short-sighted and unsustainable resource extraction from the earth
- Cognitive Limitations
	- Left-brain dominance
	- attention limits
	- memory limits
	- lack of nuance
	- cognitive biases
	- [add more here]
	- hyper-rationalism
	- predict and control
	- obsession with metrics
	- Short-term thinking with immediate gains rather than long-term sustainability in mind
	- top down methodologies
	- scientific reductionism
	- technological determinism
		- The belief that technology alone will solve all problems, often leading to a neglect of social and ethical considerations.
- Colonialism and Hubris
	- design from afar
	- design thinking
	- imposed uniformity
	- pride and hubris
	- ignorance and ego
	- flawed view of intelligence
## Getting Out of the Mess
It's easy to read all of the above and slip into deep cynicism, nihilism, defeatism, relegation to complicity, and disengagement. In fact, that's kind of the majority stance.

But we cannot do that and must resist it at all costs if we are to live in a better world. The only way out of this mess is through a mass awakening movement and a conscious effort of collective action. There is no other way.

Clever incentive mechanisms and game theory aren't enough.

LLMs are not enough.

We need radically liberative tools to help us:
- imagine the unimagined
- share knowledge with each other
- make sense of the world together
- cope with our deficits
- amplify our strengths
- discover, connect, and coordinate with each other across space and time

We need to imagine and co-create alternative economic, social, and technological systems to the existing ones so we can get out from underneath their oppressive weight.

This is the goal of the Seption project.
