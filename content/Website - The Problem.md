 I should be able to just...


Creating software for user agency isn't enough. We must also 
1. Inform users about what their new abilities are
2. Invite users to imagine their own perferred usage, so that they may start to think in terms of what they can now do
3. Foster a community of users such that they know how to weild agency wisely and ethically.


# We suffer a lack of Agency,
whether we are conscious of it or not, via:
## 1. Lack of Interoperability (we are trapped by walled app silos)
- Interoperability is a significant problem for collaborative knowledge work and sensemaking. It is a process with such workflow and organizational friction between app silos that people don't even bother.
- fractured, siloed, divided, incompatible 
- openness
- extensibility/customization personalization, need radical compatibility
20. Fragmentation of data, workflows, and digital identity across platforms
22. Lack of tools for effective collaborative sense-making, my stuff and your stuff can't interoperate
29. Limited support for integrating formal and informal knowledge structures
## 2. Lack of Sovereignty (we can't do what we want with our stuff)
- We currently don't have ownership/power/sovereignty over our data, software, or identities, even if we use our own hardware.
- extraction, centralization and control
- identity
- corporate capture
- governance, collective ownership
- value capture, wealth accumulation, unequal share of value
- dependence on network (server) online, service providers
- link rot
- the algorithm
- Enshittification
- surveillance
- Challenges in maintaining long-term digital preservation
- Difficulty in managing information across different devices and platforms
- Inadequate tools for managing information privacy and selective sharing
- offline? Your data is completely inaccessible. I want my data on my device
- selective sharing with permission policies I choose
- local only option
## 3. Lack of good design (we are stuck with one-size-fits-none software)
- Limits and control of how we may think.
- Discrimination and bias in tools and interfaces
- tyranny of classification
- organization
- colonialist tools and interfaces
- control
- file formats and data formats
- imposed uniformity
- personalization
- spatial locality of information
- the algorithm
- I think in terms of concepts and relationships
- I think in terms of time, provenance
- i think in terms of visuals
- I think in terms of space
- I think in terms of geography
- I think in terms of contexts, metadata
- Lack of context preservation across different tools and platforms
- Inadequate tools for visualizing abstract concepts and relationships
- Limited support for non-textual information (e.g., audio, visual, spatial)
- Lack of intuitive interfaces for complex information management
- Limited support for non-linear storytelling and narrative structures
- Difficulty in representing and working with temporal relationships in data
- Difficulty in representing and working with emotional or experiential information
- Challenges in managing information across different levels of abstraction
- Lack of support for managing and utilizing embodied or kinesthetic knowledge
- Intuitive interfaces for complex information
- The appropriate amount of integration between personal and professional information/contexts (and any other information/contexts)
- Discovery is broken

## 4. Lack of cognitive support (we are limited by weaknesses that prevent us from moving forward)
Cyborgify me
- I want a cognitive prosthetic to help me make sense and remember and process information and create outputs
- complexity
- cognitive biases
- missing context
- helper agents
- information firehose
- discrimination of poor quality and bad info
- accessibility and education
- linear vs non-linear thinking conversion
- capacity for nuance
- attention allocation, hijacking
- Limited support for different thinking styles and cognitive processes
- workflows -> publishing, publishing friction
- decision fatigue
- information overload 
- Difficulty in working with conflicting or contradictory information
- Limited tools for analyzing and synthesizing large amounts of highly interrelated information
- Difficulty in representing and working with probabilistic or uncertain information with varying levels of certainty or reliability
- Challenges in balancing information depth vs. breadth in knowledge representation
- Lack of effective tools for managing information overload and digital detox
- Lack of tools for seamless transitions between divergent and convergent thinking
- Limited tools for effective knowledge curation and distillation
- Difficulty in representing and working with multidimensional or hyperdimensional concepts
- Inadequate tools for collecting and processing personal data streams (e.g., IoT, wearables), personal metrics and automations to help me do better and be better
- Challenges in managing the tension between information openness and privacy/security

## 5. Lack of accessibility to public information and knowledge (we struggle to find what we are looking for)
- search is broken, how to discover, explore, browse
- where to look?
- no transparency
- how do we know what is true
- rely on an antagonistic algorithm
- relational and resonance discovery
- semantics
- Provenance- where did this come from?
- We are all solving the same problems but we are not learning from each other
- Challenges in representing and working with tacit knowledge
- no offline caching, inaccessible offline
- Difficulty in capturing and preserving context-dependent knowledge
- Challenges in managing and utilizing collective intelligence effectively
- Link rot, universal Long-term digital preservation lacking
- Limited support for multilingual and cross-cultural information management
